# Predicting Music Taste with Spotify

In this project, I use Spotify-generated metrics to predict whether a friend will like a given song or not. I
analyze the music data of a friend and avid Spotify user, Antoine, who has collected 2370 songs over the past 
few months and has classified each song into one of two categories â€“ liked or disliked. Each song is described by 23 features, 
generated by Spotify and retrieved using its API. These features include musical measures created by Spotify developers, like danceability and speechiness. 
They also include several musical qualities, like tempo, duration and time signature. Metrics regarding artist popularity and song popularity are also included.

In exploring this data and testing various classifiers, I analyze the predictive ability of these Spotify-generated metrics. 
Could traditional musical measures be used to identify a person's music taste? What about popularity scores generated by Spotify?
